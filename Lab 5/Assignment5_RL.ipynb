Recall that for a policy to be optimal, it must satisfy the Bellman equation above, meaning that plugging in a given candidate $V^*$ in the right-hand side (RHS) of the Bellman equation should result in the same $V^*$ on the left-hand side (LHS). This property will form the basis of our algorithm. Essentially, it can be shown that repeated application of the RHS to any intial value function $V^0(s)$ will eventually lead to the value $V$ which statifies the Bellman equation. Hence repeated application of the Bellman equation will also lead to the optimal value function. We can then extract the optimal policy by simply noting what actions that satisfy the equation.

Regardless of the initial values we will run the algorithm until we reach values where the path does not differ more than epsilon and the values will converge towards similar values. The reason for this is that the difference between two values of the iteration will always be higher than epsilon before we reach a path that is optimal, or close to it if epsilon is too high. We can however exploit the initial values to get towards the optimal path in fewer iterations, for example if we holistically guess that the values will reach around 40, we can set the initial values to it and thereby reach the optimal path in fewer iterations."

However in almost all cases Q-learning finds the proper path, especially if we have a relatively high exploration rate. The values obtained are not the exact same values, but they differ by roughly the same proportion between each state (in value iteration vs explore action in Q-learning)."

        "In for example our N-Chain (N=5) it does not benefit the model to go to state 2,3 or 4. Without exploration it would therefore be the best for the model to simply stay at state 1 (if the default action is to stay). However since we have exploration in our model it finds that it is actually more valuable to go towards state 5 (in most iterations). Without exploration the incentive to look for the value in state 5 would not exist and as such would never be found. We can even see in our example that our exploration rate might be a bit low, as it seems to have trouble between deciding to stay or go forwards in the first state. As a sidenote, if the default action would be to go forwards, the algorithm still wouldn't be optimal for all versions of N-Chain. For example if we increase the chain to be a lot longer it would be better to stay at the start, but a RL algorithm without exploration would not explore the possibility that staying still would be optimal."

        "**5a)** Give a summary of how a decision tree works and how it extends to random forests.\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision tree is a classification method that in each step of the algorithm splits the data into two or more branches according to a certain feature. This will in the end build a tree where the leaf nodes are the different classes of data. \n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let’s consider 6 farm animals (2 dogs, 1 pig, 3 chickens) that should be classified. In the first step we cloud split the data with the question \"*Have 4 legs*\". Now we have 2 branches one there all animals have 4 legs (dogs and pigs) and one there they do not have 4 legs (chickens). We now split the first group again with the question \"*Have long fur*\" splitting the group into two new branches one with the dog and one with the pigs. This example was rather trivial, but it highlights how decision trees work. \n",
        "\n",
        "But decision trees have some problems, for one they are very sensitive to difference in input data. For example, if one of the dogs in the previous example would only have 3 legs it would have ended up with the chickens instead and not been able to be grouped with the other dog. \n",
        "\n",
        "One method to mitigate the problems with decision trees are random forest, where you create N different decision trees on different subsets of the data and feature set. New data is then classified by majority vote in the forest. \n",

        "**5b)** Explain what makes reinforcement learning different from supervised learning tasks such as regression or classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "In supervised learning we have a large set of label data and want to find patterns in the data in order to be able to predict the label of a new datapoint. But there are applications that does not lend themselves to this approach for example there might not be any good datasets or the AI need to adapt to what's happening. A pratical example of this is creating AIs that play games like StarCraft II or Go.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead for applications like this reinforcement learning is often used where you have a enviroment (the go board), a state (where each piece is located on the board), a set of possible actions (what pieces can be moved where) and an agent (the AI who decides what action to take). You then let the agent decide what action from the action set to take depending on the state and the enviroment then returns a new state, action set and a reward depending on if the action was good, neutral or bad. The agent is then trained to maximize the reward. With this approach you don't need large sets of data, you only need a enviroment, a set of possible action depending on the state and some rewardfunction and the training data is created as the agent takes actions on the eviroment.
